# Access-control-System-with-GLCD Part 1

This is PART 1 of the group project for EEE20003 - Embedded Micro-controllers

**Project Description **

Capacitive sensors provide an alternative to the traditional mechanical buttons 
and sliders in electronics. These sensors work by sensing a conductive object 
nearby rather than detecting the physical state of the device. One of the 
applications is for the access control system. It is important to make a clear 
distinction between authentication and access control. Correctly establishing 
the identity of the user is the responsibility of the authentication service. 
Access control assumes that authentication of the user has been successfully 
verified prior to the enforcement of access control. 

**Design Requirement Part 1 (simulation - Online) **
* Students will use the simulator to explore components includes 
keypad, SSD1306 OLED display and Arduino Mega microcontroller. 
* Program the microcontroller to read input from keypad and displaying 
the input in the display. Use the student ID of each member as the 
passcode. If the passcode is entered correctly, shows different 
symbol/figure for correct authentication, which can differentiate each 
member otherwise shows incorrect symbol/figure in the display 
* Important interrupt routine is not needed for this part.  
* Assignment due date: this is part of the assignment for Portfolio-Project 
Progress and Portfolio-Project Report.
